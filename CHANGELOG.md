# Changelog — zmk-keybeacon

All notable changes to the KeyBeacon Zephyr module are documented here. The module follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): consumers pin a tag via `revision` in their `west.yml`.

## Versioning policy

| Change | Example | Version bump |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Breaking change to the GATT contract | Service/characteristic UUID change, payload layout change | **MAJOR** |
| Backward-compatible addition | A new optional Kconfig symbol | **MINOR** |
| Fix with no interface change | Bug fix in change-detection, doc fix | **PATCH** |

Because consumers pin an exact tag, publishing a new version never affects an existing build
until that consumer bumps its `revision`.

## [1.1.3] — 2026-10-10

**PATCH** release — bug fix with no wire-contract change. All KBP 1.1 bytes, UUIDs, Kconfig
symbols, and the AA1 KBP 1.0 characteristic remain byte-for-byte identical to v1.1.0–v1.1.2.

### Fixed

- **`right_online` now tracks the actual BLE split link instead of a battery-event TTL.**
  The root cause of the "right half persistently shows offline while typing" bug was that
  `right_online` was derived from a freshness window on `zmk_peripheral_battery_state_changed`
  events. ZMK's `battery.c` only raises that event (and therefore the peripheral BAS notify
  proxy on the central) **when `state_of_charge` changes** — on a keyboard at a stable charge
  the event can be tens of minutes apart, so any TTL eventually expires even while the split
  link is fully healthy.

  The reliable signal is already present in ZMK: `split_central_disconnected()` in
  `app/src/split/bluetooth/central.c` raises `zmk_peripheral_battery_state_changed` with
  `state_of_charge = 0` on every disconnect; the initial BAS read/subscribe after connect
  delivers the real level (`> 0`). `peripheral_battery_slot` gains a `connected` bool that
  is set on `state_of_charge > 0` and cleared on `state_of_charge == 0`. `right_online` now
  reads `peripheral_slots[0].connected`, and the TTL constant `KBP_PERIPHERAL_FRESH_MS` and
  `kbp_peripheral_fresh()` are removed entirely.

  Edge-case accepted: a peripheral that is connected but genuinely at 0 % is
  indistinguishable from the disconnect sentinel; in practice such a peripheral disconnects
  long before its charge reaches 0 %.

  `last_seen_ms` is retained solely by the Battery characteristic (`batt_build_payload`) to
  decide whether any reading has ever been received — its meaning is unchanged for that use.

## [1.1.3] — 2026-10-10（中文）

**PATCH** 版本——修复一个 bug，无线上协议变动。所有 KBP 1.1 字节、UUID、Kconfig 符号以及
AA1（KBP 1.0）特征与 v1.1.0–v1.1.2 逐字节一致。

### 修复

- **`right_online` 现在追踪真实的 BLE 分体链路，而非电量事件的 TTL。**
  "右手持续显示离线、但实际正常使用"这一问题的根因：`right_online` 依赖
  `zmk_peripheral_battery_state_changed` 事件的新鲜度窗口。而 ZMK 的 `battery.c` 仅在
  `state_of_charge` **发生变化时**才触发该事件（从而触发 central 上的 BAS notify 代理）——
  电量稳定的键盘可以数十分钟不发送此事件，任何时间窗口都会在链路健在时过期。

  可靠的信号已存在于 ZMK 中：`central.c` 的 `split_central_disconnected()` 在每次断连时
  以 `state_of_charge = 0` 触发 `zmk_peripheral_battery_state_changed`；连接后的首次 BAS
  读/订阅会返回真实电量（`> 0`）。`peripheral_battery_slot` 新增 `connected` bool：收到
  `> 0` 置 true，收到 `0` 置 false。`right_online` 改为读取
  `peripheral_slots[0].connected`，TTL 常量 `KBP_PERIPHERAL_FRESH_MS` 与
  `kbp_peripheral_fresh()` 已彻底移除。

  已知边界情况：真实在线但电量恰好为 0% 的 peripheral 与断连哨兵无法区分；实践中此类
  peripheral 在电量到零前早已断连。

  `last_seen_ms` 仅保留用于 Battery 特征（`batt_build_payload`）判断是否曾收到过任何读数，
  其语义不变。

**PATCH** release — bug fix with no wire-contract change. All KBP 1.1 bytes, UUIDs, Kconfig
symbols, and the AA1 KBP 1.0 characteristic remain byte-for-byte identical to v1.1.0 / v1.1.1.

### Fixed

- **AA3 `right_percent` no longer flaps between the last-known value and `255`.** Even with
  the v1.1.1 TTL extension to 75 s, independent 1 Hz work queues for AA2 and AA3 could cross
  the freshness boundary at slightly different wall-clock moments, producing a visible skew
  where the floating panel showed `●R72` → `●R—` → `●R72` while the online dot stayed green.
  The underlying design mistake was coupling the battery byte to the TTL at all: the TTL is a
  liveness proxy and belongs on `AA2.split_flags.right_online`, not on the electrochemical
  state-of-charge value. The battery byte should hold the last-known reading until either (a)
  the module boots without ever receiving an event, or (b) the peripheral explicitly reports
  an unavailable sample. v1.1.2 removes the TTL coupling in `batt_build_payload`, so the byte
  tracks `peripheral_slots[0].last_percent` whenever `last_seen_ms > 0`.
- A follow-up to `contracts/battery-characteristic.md §6` ("Peripheral sync-bus temporarily
  lost: `right_percent` stays at last-known value for up to 10 s, then transitions to `255`")
  is pending in the main `keybeacon` repository to reflect the corrected semantics.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-10-09

**PATCH** release — bug fix with no wire-contract change. All KBP 1.1 bytes, UUIDs, Kconfig
symbols, and the AA1 KBP 1.0 characteristic remain byte-for-byte identical to v1.1.0.

### Fixed

- **Peripheral freshness window** (`KBP_PERIPHERAL_FRESH_MS`) raised from 10 s to **75 s**. The
  10 s value in v1.1.0 was derived from `research.md §R1` under the (incorrect) assumption
  that the peripheral emits events on split-sync state changes. In practice the
  `zmk_peripheral_battery_state_changed` proxy event is triggered by the standard periodic BAS
  notify, whose default cadence is `CONFIG_ZMK_BATTERY_REPORT_INTERVAL=60 s`. With a 10 s TTL
  the central would therefore mark the peripheral offline ~50 s out of every 60 s window even
  on a fully healthy split keyboard; AA2.split_flags.right_online would flip to `0` and
  AA3.right_percent would fall back to the unavailable sentinel (`255`). 75 s gives a 1.25×
  margin on the default report interval, tolerating a single missed notify without flipping
  the online bit. Keyboard authors who shorten `BATTERY_REPORT_INTERVAL` keep working
  unchanged; those who lengthen it should bump this proportionally in a fork.

### Documentation note

`specs/002-zmk-keybeacon-kbp11/research.md §R1` and `contracts/connectivity-characteristic.md`
in the main `keybeacon` repository will be updated in a follow-up to describe the correct
notify-based event model.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-10-09

Additive **MINOR** release implementing KBP 1.1 Connectivity + Power. Service UUID unchanged;
the KBP 1.0 characteristic `AA440AA1-…` is **byte-for-byte identical** to v1.0.0 (same
declaration, same CCC, same emission cadence). KBP 1.0 hosts continue to work unchanged.

### Added

- **AA2 Connectivity characteristic** `AA440AA2-F5ED-4C48-84A1-8062D20D3D55` (optional,
  READ|NOTIFY + CCC, 7-byte payload per `protocol/README.md §14.3.1`): capability_bits,
  host_state, profile_byte, profile_max_slots, split_link_flags, output_endpoint,
  charging_flags.
- **AA3 Battery characteristic** `AA440AA3-F5ED-4C48-84A1-8062D20D3D55` (optional,
  READ|NOTIFY + CCC, 1-byte on integer boards / 2-byte on splits per `protocol/README.md
  §14.4.1`): `[overall]` or `[left, right]` with `255` as "temporarily unavailable" sentinel.
- Two new Kconfig sub-options under `CONFIG_ZMK_KEYBEACON` (both `default y` so a consumer
  simply bumps `revision: v1.0.0 → v1.1.0` to pick up the new characteristics with zero
  `.conf` edits):
  - `CONFIG_ZMK_KEYBEACON_CONNECTIVITY` — gates AA2.
  - `CONFIG_ZMK_KEYBEACON_BATTERY` — gates AA3.
- ZMK event subscriptions: `zmk_ble_active_profile_changed`, `zmk_endpoint_changed`,
  `zmk_battery_state_changed`, `zmk_peripheral_battery_state_changed` (last one is gated on
  `CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_BLE`).
- 1 Hz `k_work_delayable` worker to satisfy the §14.4.5 OR-relation `≥ 1 s` floor for the
  Battery characteristic's throttling policy.
- `BUILD_ASSERT`s guarding the Connectivity payload length (7 bytes) and the Battery payload
  length (1 or 2 bytes depending on `IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT)`).
- `has_left_charging` and `has_right_charging` capability bits — both wired to `0` in this
  release. A follow-up (`v1.2.x` or board-overlay-driven) can read a per-board charger GPIO.

### Backward compatibility

- Service UUID `AA440AA0-F5ED-4C48-84A1-8062D20D3D55` unchanged.
- Characteristic `AA440AA1-F5ED-4C48-84A1-8062D20D3D55` unchanged (same `BT_GATT_CHARACTERISTIC`
  + `BT_GATT_CCC` block, same `bt_gatt_notify(…, &keybeacon_svc.attrs[1], …)` call site, same
  change-detect suppression).
- The combination `CONFIG_ZMK_KEYBEACON=y, CONFIG_ZMK_KEYBEACON_CONNECTIVITY=n,
  CONFIG_ZMK_KEYBEACON_BATTERY=n` on this v1.1.0 module produces GATT output that is
  **byte-indistinguishable** from a `revision: v1.0.0` build.

### Versioning rationale

Semver **MINOR**: additive new characteristics (KBP §9 "adding a new optional characteristic
or descriptor; service UUID unchanged"). Existing consumers are unaffected until they bump
`revision` in their `west.yml`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-10-07

Initial release as a standalone Zephyr module, extracted unchanged from the Totem firmware repo's
`config/keybeacon_kit/`.

### Added

- `zephyr/module.yml` + `CMakeLists.txt` wrapper so the feature integrates through `west.yml`
  with no `include()`/`rsource` wiring in the consuming shield.
- `keybeacon.c` — custom GATT service exposing the active layer index, modifier flags, and layer
  name as a notify-on-change snapshot `[layer_index][mods][layer_name]`.
- `Kconfig.keybeacon` — `CONFIG_ZMK_KEYBEACON` (bool, `depends on ZMK_BLE`, `default n`).
- `keybeacon.cmake` — central-only guard
  (`CONFIG_ZMK_KEYBEACON AND CONFIG_ZMK_BLE AND CONFIG_ZMK_SPLIT_ROLE_CENTRAL`).

### Contract

- GATT service UUID `AA440AA0-F5ED-4C48-84A1-8062D20D3D55`, characteristic
  `AA440AA1-F5ED-4C48-84A1-8062D20D3D55`. Unchanged from the pre-module kit — no protocol bump.
